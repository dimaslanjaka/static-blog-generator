Fishing in the legend of neverland is an important activity to collect fish and then sell them and get 'water essences'. Water Essences are used to buy ingredients in the `cooking shop`. You can see the recipe at [Cooking Recipes](/The%20Legend%20Of%20Neverland/Recipes.html).
You can cook buffs for your character or make dishes to increase the level of `Fairies` you have.
This time you can auto-fish using `bluestacks` and `macros`.

  ## Calculating the fishing actions
<ul>
  <li><span>1 bottle = 300 staminas</span> &divide; 5/action &rarr; <span>
      <script>
        document.write(300 / 5);
      </script> actions
    </span>.</li>
  <li><span>1 fishing = &plusmn;7-8 secs (we take 7 secs)</span></li>
  <li><span>7 x 60 actions &erarr; <script>
        document.write(7 * 60)
      </script> seconds &divide; 60 secs (1 min)</span> = <span>
      <script>
        document.write(420 / 60)
      </script> minutes
    </span> <span>to finish 1 stamina bottle</span></li>
</ul>
  
  ## Configuration
  - First of all, make sure the position of the stamina bottle in your inventory/bag is in the second slot

  - set `repeat actions` with the total stamina bottle you have, or my recommendation is to subtract a little from the total stamina bottle you have. for example you have 55 bottles, set just 50 repeat actions, this to prevent other items to be used unexpectedly/unintentionally.
