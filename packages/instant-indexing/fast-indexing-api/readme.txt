A very efficient yet simple plugin to take care of your indexing woos and helps get your content crawled by search bots instantly.

== Description ==

### Get your website's pages, and content crawled immediately! Use the Instant Indexing plugin to beat your competition and rank higher.

★★★★★<br>

> **Note**: Google recommends that you use the Indexing API ONLY for Job Posting and Live Streaming websites. However, it works on any type of website and many of our users have seen great results already. Please proceed with caution.

Whether you are a novice blogger or a seasoned SEO - you know the importance of getting into the Google index. It is the very first step before your website can see any organic traffic coming from Google or any other search engine.

If your pages don't get indexed, your website is essentially invisible to Google and all the visitors - visitors that would otherwise "see" your website in the search engines.

So, it is pretty important that your new content gets crawled/indexed fast, and it is equally important for your already published content to get updated in Google as well.

How do you do one or the other? Or, how about doing them both?

**Enter the Instant Indexing plugin by Rank Math**

When you publish new content or update old content on your WordPress website, the Instant Indexing plugin sends a crawl request to Google using the Google Indexing API.

The result? **Almost immediate indexing of your content**. [Here is an example](https://rankmath.com/blog/google-indexing-api/#proof).

There are a lot of plus points of having your content instantly crawled and indexed by the search engines, but, here are a few major advantages of using the Instant Indexing plugin:

* **Rank faster** - Have that awesome content you know users will like? Get it in front of your audience faster.
* Increase your chances of ranking above your competition
* Keep search results up-to-date
* One-time Setup
* **Automatic Submissions**
* Manual Submissions
* Excludes Custom Post Types
* Send request to remove Post from Google SERPs
* Get Current Post Status
* Compatible with Any SEO WordPress Plugin
* Bulk Submissions (Up to 100 URLs)
* Completely FREE.

There is just no reason not to give it a try.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin without Rank Math? =
Yes, you absolutely can. You can use the Instant Indexing plugin with any SEO plugin you like. But, we recommend using the Instant Indexing API plugin with [Rank Math SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/) for best results.

= Can I submit pages that do not have Job Posting or Livestream structured data? =
Although the Google Indexing API officially supports pages containing Job Posting and Livestream structured data - it is officially recommended to use only on such websites. But, it can be used with any website. But, do proceed with caution if you are not comfortable with this.
