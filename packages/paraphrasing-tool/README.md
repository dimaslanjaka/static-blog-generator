## 3 Different modes for paraphrasing:

* Standard Mode: Most conservative mode while rephrasing. The rephrased sentences will be very close to the original.
* Fluent Mode: Happy middle ground between 'Standard' and 'Creative'. Tries to change the sentence while trying to keep the meaning intact.
* Creative Mode: Tries to change the sentence most but quite likely to have errors.

## Technologies used:

* NextJS for the front end.
* TailwindCSS for styling.
