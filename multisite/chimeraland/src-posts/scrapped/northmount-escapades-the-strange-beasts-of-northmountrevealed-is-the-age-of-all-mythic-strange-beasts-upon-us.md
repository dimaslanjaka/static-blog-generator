<p align="center">★</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-US">With the launch of Northmount, strange beasts have been affected by a fluctuation of spirit power, making them </span><span lang="en-US">more powerful</span><span lang="en-US">! All non-deobeast strange beasts can transform to Mythic grade. All deobeasts can </span><span lang="en-US">transform to Double Mythic grade</span><span lang="en-US">. The transformation process is similar to the transforming from Noble to Illustrious: Feed your strange beast eggs (including Grand and Noble strange beast eggs from the original three continents, new Grand and Noble strange beast eggs from Northmount, Limitless Blood Eggs, etc.) to gather marks, then use the indicated Diviner Pill to finish the breakthrough. Specific Diviner Pill formulae below:</span></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">● <span lang="en-US">Diviner Pill (Mountain)</span><span lang="en-US"> = </span><span lang="en-US">True Bufonidae Hide ×4 + Dragon Pearl ×6 + Centaur Bone ×15 + Illustrious Beast Soul ×4</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Diviner Pill (Swamp)</span><span lang="en-US"> = Grassfish Scale ×4 + Yurlunggur's Fang ×6 + Loggerhead Hide ×15 + Illustrious Beast Soul ×4</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Diviner Pill (Sky)</span><span lang="en-US"> = </span><span lang="en-US">Polar Feathered Steed Feather ×4 + Feathered Steed Wing ×6 + Cassowary Feather ×15 + Illustrious Beast Soul ×4</span></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-US">You will see </span><span lang="en-US">obvious changes</span><span lang="en-US"> to a pet's level, quality, and Treats after they have been transformed. While all strange beasts will see an obvious increase in power, </span><span lang="en-US">they're still nothing compared to Deobeasts</span><span lang="en-US">! And although the process of transformation is the same for all beasts, deobeasts still have a higher power limit! After transformation, you'll see improvements in the following attributes:</span></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Level:</span> <span lang="en-US">The level limit of Mythic beasts is increased to Lv. 70; for deobeasts, it is increased to Lv. 75. With a higher level, you can have a better Basic Stats model.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Treats:</span> <span lang="en-US">The Treats limit for Mythic beasts is increased to 70; for deobeasts, it is increased to 90.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Talents:</span> <span lang="en-US">After transforming, deobeasts will have transformed talent attributes, as well as greatly enhanced attributes and battle power.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Skill Slots:</span> <span lang="en-US">Mythic beasts have 8 skill slots.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Quality:</span> <span lang="en-US">As level, Treats, and talents give deobeasts a great advantage in attributes and real-world battle power, we gave Mythic beasts a higher increase in quality. After transformation, Mythic beasts receive a +10 bonus to each type of quality. Deobeasts receive a +5 bonus.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">●&nbsp;<span lang="en-US">Battle Power:</span> <span lang="en-US">In this test of battle power increases, Illustrious strange beasts receive +8,000 battle power and deobeasts receive +9,455 after transformation!</span></p>
