They're All in Northmount!</div><div class="news_date">2022-10-25</div><div id="news_player"></div><p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">The new strange beasts of Northmount have been revealed!</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Vindkaldr</span><span lang="en-US">: This strange beast is shaped like a human face. It has goat horns and tiger claws, and is forever swimming in the great abyss, in and out of the light.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Be it from the size of its body or its unique appearance, you can definitely tell this strange beast has </span><span lang="en-US">extraordinary ability</span><span lang="en-US">! Seeing as this is a new strange beast coming to Northmount, why don't you try guessing </span><span lang="en-US">how powerful</span><span lang="en-US"> it is?</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">In addition to the Vindkaldr, tons of new strange beasts will be coming to Northmount, with levels ranging from common strange beasts all the way to Illustrious strange beasts.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Scenic Spots Also Hold Hidden Dangers?</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Along with Northmount's new strange beasts, we've also added an all-new activity to Northmount: Scenic Spot Challenges. A great deal of new Scenic Spots will be added to Northmount. Just like on the current three continents, travelers will receive a certain EXP reward upon unlocking Scenic Spots. However, Northmount's Scenic Spots will possess an additional </span><span lang="en-US">new mechanic</span><span lang="en-US">: When travelers unlock some Scenic Spots, they might trigger an all-new challenge. Upon unlocking different Scenic Spots, there's a chance </span><span lang="en-US">monsters will be spawned to stop you from unlocking the Scenic Spot</span><span lang="en-US">. When this happens, you'll have to defeat the monsters before interacting the with the Scenic Spot again. The spawned monsters won't just be for one traveler to defeat, either—everyone can work together to challenge them!</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">An Ancient Artifact Has Appeared in Northmount!</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">By participating in Northmount activities, you can obtain and grow an all-new </span><span lang="en-US">ancient artifact—the Imperius Sword</span><span lang="en-US">! Great, latent energy is held within the Imperius Sword. If you carefully grow the sword, you should be able to </span><span lang="en-US">unleash its enormous power!</span><span lang="en-US"> Not only will it improve your power, but it'll also improve your overall battle experience! This new Divine Weapon </span><span lang="en-US">available to all</span><span lang="en-US"> is not only a gift for travelers, but also an all-new challenge to face.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">As Crisis Mounts, Strange Anomalies and Sudden Changes Abound</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Due to the </span><span lang="en-US">influence of Divine Power</span><span lang="en-US">, Northmount's climate seems to have become </span><span lang="en-US">unpredictable</span><span lang="en-US">. When Northmount experiences extreme weather, the strange beasts and gatherable items of some regions undergo </span><span lang="en-US">fascinating changes</span><span lang="en-US">.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Not Even Plants are Simple?</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">The trees of Northmount are not just eye candy. Travelers can not only use special items to </span><span lang="en-US">chop</span><span lang="en-US"> them for their product, but they can also deliver certain items to </span><span lang="en-US">cultivate Sacred Trees</span><span lang="en-US">. Once these Sacred Trees are cultivated, monsters will spawn around them. Travelers can defeat these monsters to </span><span lang="en-US">obtain the corresponding rewards</span><span lang="en-US">!</span></p>
<p align="justify"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://sg-chimeraland.playerinfinite.com/cms/nrft/feeds/pic/6d18eb24aa7c3e3838a2130f3a21c6e2.png" width="1246" height="701"></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">The plants of Northmount also have a similar function. Travelers can interact with these plants and offer them items meeting certain requirements. Once they have done so, the plants will infuse travelers with Divine Power, giving them </span><span lang="en-US">all kinds of rewards</span><span lang="en-US">.</span></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-US">Northmount is slowly rising from the sea, and as it does new content will be unlocked and made available to our travelers. Get ready—new challenges are on the way! Well, that's all for now!</span></p>
