(III) Blizzards 

Due to the influence of Hafslange's Divine Power, Northmount is sometimes beset by special snowstorm weather. These snowstorms cause different levels of mutation to nearby plants and strange beasts.

Through their investigations, the Chimeraland Team has finally discovered the patterns and secrets behind these special snowstorms: Blizzards.

1\. Generation Patterns

Blizzards aren't constantly active in Northmount, but change according to a pattern. Just like how you have a set time you go to school or work, Blizzards also have an active period, dormant period, and raging period. During the dormant period, no snowstorms will be generated in Northmount; during the active period, snowstorms will occasionally appear within Northmount; and during the raging period, the chance of snowstorms appearing and the number that appear in Northmount will greatly increase. Be sure to pay attention and act appropriately.

◆ Active Period: 11:00--1:00 (server time)

◆ Dormant Period: 2:00--10:00 (server time)

◆ Raging Period: 20:00--23:00 (server time)

◆ *Special Raging Period: Weekends 12:00--15:00 (server time)

2\. Other Mysteries

Sacred Tree: Black Mulberry, the celestial stalk beneflower, and tons of powerful mutated monsters will appear in areas impacted by snowstorms created by Blizzards. While it is nice to be able to get celestial stalks and Sacred Trees fairly effortlessly, if you're searching for the original residents of areas affected by snowstorms, they can be quite a hinderance.

"I know this Blizzard is in its active period, but I have no idea when it will finally be over. It'd be awesome if I could just shut it off." I'm sure a million travelers have had this exact thought.

Let me tell you all a secret: The Chimeraland Team's investigations have shown that, in fact, Blizzards can be controlled---albeit only to the extent of turning them off. But, still a pretty good discovery, right?

According to their reports, in the process of considering the link between Blizzards and Black Mulberry Sacred Trees, the Chimeraland Team rallied everyone they could to try and complete Black Mulberry Trials in an area affected by mutation. In their first attempt, it was only when the final Black Mulberry Trial was completed that the region returned to normal. In proceeding attempts, however, they only had to complete 2 or 3 Black Mulberry Trials to remove the mutation.

In addition to this, the Chimeraland Team also discovered another anomalous weather besides Blizzards. While this weather also manifested itself in the form of snowstorms, no Sacred Trees or celestial stalks appeared under its effect. After rigorous investigation, the team finally discovered that the weather was actually coming from giant beasts. The sources of that particular instance were a 30,000-year Illustrious Vindkaldr and an 18,000-year Illustrious Polar Feathered Steed. Once they were defeated, the mutation subsequently ended.

While the mutation was different in each of the cases above, the basic principle of removing them was the same: Destroy the source. So, if you want to get rid of a mutation, find and destroy its source!

3\. Black Mulberry Trial Format

The Black Mulberry is one of the most special of the Sacred Trees. It is also the source of Blizzards. As such, the difficulty and format of Black Mulberry Trials is much different from the other Sacred Trees.

In the Black Mulberry Trial, your opponent is an enormously powerful boss. Only by defeating the boss can you obtain the trial rewards.

4\. Rewards

Rewards are settled once the Black Mulberry Trial has been successfully completed. Team members can roll to distribute rewards or decide amongst themselves how to divvy the rewards.

Given how special the Black Mulberry Trial is, its rewards are also extraordinary. Not only will you get items dropped by defeating the boss, but there is also the chance of getting Divine Weapon Stones, Divine Weapon Weapon Souls, and Xiangliu shards from Black Mulberry Trials.

Tips: It's worth mentioning that when a traveler obtains Xiangliu shards, the Blizzard will immediately cease, and all products of the mutation (including snowstorms and Sacred Trees) will disappear.

![Black Mulberry Trial](/chimeraland/northmount-released/mulberry-trial.png)

I'm not sure if any travelers will avoid participating in Black Mulberry Trials to keep the abundant celestial stalks around, but I'll say just in case: It's easy to get celestial stalks. The rewards for the Black Mulberry Trial on the other hand---not so easy. If the chance arises, give priority to the Black Mulberry Trial! After all, if you're in the right place, all you have to do is use Search > Resources > Encounter > Celestial Stalk and you'll be able to find tons of them!
